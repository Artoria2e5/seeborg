This bot will sit on IRC channel, learn what people talk there, and will periodically reply with a phrase that's generated from the talk it learned before.

Usually the bot doesn't make any sense, but it's funny, and sometimes very hilarious.

Seeborg uses a variation of Markov Chain algorithm for building replies. It's a C++ clone of Pyborg, originally written by Tom Morton.
