SeeBorg [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/hmage/seeborg.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hmage/seeborg)
=======

SeeBorg is a random phrase bot based on Markov Chains.

It will sit on IRC channels you configure, will learn the words and their sequences, and will periodically reply with something that is generated from the talk it learned before.

Don't expect it to make much sense, but sometimes it can give very funny responses.

If you configure yourself as owner, you will gain access for IRC trigger commands (those that begin with '!').

It can learn in any language, not just English -- to handle case conversion properly please set the appropriate locale.

Compilation
----------------
```
git clone https://github.com/hmage/seeborg
cd seeborg
make
```

You'll end up with two executables -- `seeborg-irc` and `seeborg-linein`. The line-in binary is useful for offline chat with the bot and to test the modifications done to the dictionary.

Without any parameters, `seeborg-irc` reads configuration settings from `seeborg-irc.cfg` file, located in current working directory. If it doesn't exist, it will create one and terminate, suggesting you to inspect the config file and modify it to suit your needs.

Portability
